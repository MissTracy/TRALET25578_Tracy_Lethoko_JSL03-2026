# Project: Console-Based Task Manager

##

## Overview

This project involves creating a **simple task management system** where users can add **up to three new tasks** to an existing task array. Tasks are **stored as objects in an array**, each with a **unique incremental ID**. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. The project focuses on **array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management**.

## Key Objectives

### Logic & User Interaction

- Store tasks as **objects inside an array** for structured data management.
- Allow users to **add up to three new tasks** to the existing task list.
- Ensure each new task has a **unique incremental ID** based on the last task in the array.
- Prompt users to enter **task details (title, description, status)** and store them in an object.
- Alert users when they reach the task limit with the message:
  _"There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console."_
  Implement a **filter function** to display only tasks with the status `"done"`.
- Log **all tasks** in the console with a clear label for easy review.
- Log **only completed tasks** (status: `"done"`) in the console under a "Completed Tasks" label for quick reference.
